I am:

disillusioned,

confused,

who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she? who is she?

she is reflecting me...
all messed up
take out the garbage
in garbage out

its only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear only to help me sleep only i swear

through my teeth

my life has no direction

cute little devil

temptation
jazz and smoke and loose myself and i don't think i want to be found
something strange in here something wrong

CAUTION: artists crossing

no future
no future
no future
