my brain is rotting out of my
eyes/ears/mouth
see/hear/speak
no evil no exit no entry
plastic pharmacuticals and
plastic parasites and
all the water is screaming out
burning up burning down
broken city burning down
be he alive
be he dead
no matter no matter
off with his head
fktupfktrndfktovr
world alone worlds apart
right/left brain
left/right brain
nothing at all, used to feel
nothing at all, used to feel
demon dolls
voodoo priests
black as the tar in the lung
i am faceless
