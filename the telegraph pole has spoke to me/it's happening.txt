it's happening the truth it is terrifying me like monsters under the glass eyes full of empty and jagged pills sticking in my mouth and your lying tongue the aliens are here they came out out of the worms in here all around in here worms in here worms plastic bag dances in the wind picks me up and throws me over your house and i am poisoned like a dead serpent twisted round and round and sterile white halls like nails on walls and not as such anymore they replaced all the doors and changed the windows into other windows like eyes see in but can't see out or out not in and falling through the floor and falling apart at the seams and this is the edge of the world
