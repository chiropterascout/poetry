too much sugar darling
gonna rot ur brains like
swiss cheese is my soul
full of holes
full of holes
cardboard walls and floors and
concrete ceilings made of glass
pressing me in
gonna fall down fuck
flat batteries/spirit
undefined agenda
government agents coming over
round for coffee and tea and
abduction
