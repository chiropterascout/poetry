## untitled01

```
bolted doors
breaking on the waves and crashing head into the moors
dive into the loch and drown with all the whores

padded walls
sinking from the sky in suits as now the market falls
out from under beds the monster crawls

concrete floors
a thousand dead are rotting on the rocky shores
fingers to the reaper ectoplasm in the pores

cobwebbed halls
the waking dead are rising early on hold are the calls
burning down the whiskey joining in the brawls
```
