title: kill it if you have to

--

```
let the past die.
kill it
        if you have to.
        
that's the only way to become who you were meant to be.

the
    dreams the
               memories

let them burn like ash in a forgotten flame

let the love

die

like it never lived.

never lived and never again

never

never again
