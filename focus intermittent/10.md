```
growing mouldy growing
up too fast while
i've been seeking
your sweet sedation
and everything after
i tear off the
fucking mask under
you're painted
face tells all
i need to know
how to forget
how to read and
experimental measuring
quantitative resultant
reading from the book of
revolutions 20:05
there is no answer stop
looking here i told
you yesterday there is
no answer here no god
not here local anaesthetic
open up your brain and take
the broken pieces out
```
