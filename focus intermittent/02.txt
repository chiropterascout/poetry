no data there is no
future caution
hazardous or unusual
condition of entry
conditional love
not an exit
emergency exit only
i just got here
is the news
good or bad or
how many dead
don't know don't
worry not important
not insignificant as
a girl is a girl
and a boy is
a boy but i am he
as you are he as
you are me and we are
all together again these
chemical kids are lost in
this maze of streets
pierced eye and nose and
left behind in and out of
concrete skies
