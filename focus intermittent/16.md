```
waiting hidden eyes
watching cast downwards
slowly falling into
oceans of water and
thousands dead all the
fish drowned in the
oil painted rocks and
rendered imagery found
wanting lacking something
which is nothing they
will tell you so
tell you lies and truths
lost in the now here
is the news where are
the cameras hidden
in the other cameras
you would never think
to look to question
the anchorman is
laughing at you in
the commercial break
```
