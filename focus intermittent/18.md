```
unseeing vigil no
quarter asked nor given
clarity of thought now
ending upon us ending
drawing ever closer drawn
with blood over reluctant
pagination unconventional
now listen here listen
careful hunting the beast
rages with blood over
reluctant missionary
notices declining population
never answer the door
could be who we want it to
begin again forget the
mistakes the illusions
tired eyes and unblinking
sentinel the dry the sharp
at the back of your
mind a splinter in the
throat of the false
prophets on television
```
