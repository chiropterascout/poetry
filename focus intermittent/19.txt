unburdened reality
sequentially fading
slightly bruised ego
super ego superannuation
payable by default next
of kin who spilt the
magic beans climb the
vine heard it all with
grapes and sweet oblivion
waiting edge of the
galaxy end of the
universe incubation
timed infection seconds
ticking clocks ticking
bombs hidden under the
rooftops falling down on
everyone's head don't
look up never look up
burning sun and push
the envelope lives in
filing cabinets
