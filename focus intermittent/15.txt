reversible boundaries falling
apart at the edges
there are cracks in the
shadows watching always
watching never turn it
off never pick it up
ringing in the ears
attached to the mice
and rats in a maze
in a racing against the
seconds minutes hours
days weeks months
years of regret of
remorse no simple answer
everything went wrong
answer all questions
asked by government
agents back for more
coffee and reintegration
into society inherently
flawed production
of the genetic elitists
