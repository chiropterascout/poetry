```
take me to your
leader take me to
your god sorry
didn't hear the door
on the phone
watching the news
latest breaking was
happening all along
there is no way out
no escape no end
have to go out later
can't sorry have to
go out and get the
milk and bread and
radioactive waste
no paper running out of
trees all dying no more
oil all over the rocks
have to save it from the
birds and fish and
ghosts in here i can
see them with my eyes
```
