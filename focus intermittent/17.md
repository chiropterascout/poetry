```
fragments disillusioned
sharp and bright and
bittersweet salt the
eyes sour the mind
your own self loathing
the silence the silence
never waking never
breaking point stress
related injury no more
shattered pieces broken
dreams and red bleeds with
red and white bleeds
whitewash over darkened
eyes empty hollow
stop moving stop
disbelieving their
lying eyes and twisted
serpent wrapped around
the spine is breaking
every wine glass houses
shouldn't throw stones
```
