sunday screaming silent
not a soul have no soul
pawned for the queen
sliced neck and offshore
drilling in the skull
there is the void there
nothing remains nothing
recollected symbols
mindless noise the
eye approaching form
rank and file locked
away discarded key
misguided priorities
never know the danger
here is there and
treasure buried open
and discarded key
mental order lost in
chaos creates and burns
there is no fire
only smoke only poison
words in hollow ears
can see the ghosts
