```
it is in our veins now
like a frozen moth
gonna shatter soon and
pick up the pieces
one by one by one
more drink for the
road goes ever on and
off now like my head
hurts and the sickly
sweet seduction of your
scented eyes perfumed
with regret so much
like being force fed
compliments and
comparisons
```
