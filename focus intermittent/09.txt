i can see reality
stripped away and
nothing left
inside the units
of measurement of
distance becomes
meaningless words
meaningless vision
may not be 100%
accurate firing
strike a spider at
10 miles down the
road take the first
left then on past the
roundabout spinning
around like plates
and heads will not
comprehend the true
nature of nature
