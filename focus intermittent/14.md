```
addictive behaviour addict
personality lacking depth
charges may apply only
under controlled circumstances
controlled mentalities
lacking dimensions may
vary due to errors in
manufacture a lie to
bend around the terrible
naked truth is relative
theory of time may be
lost irreplaceable never
save the seconds precious
seconds ticking away and
burning away and where
is the god damn newscast
we have a right to know to
determine the eventual
fate of our humanity so
where is the god damn
newscast for a soap opera
international performers
pulling the strings pulling
out the threads of labcoats
over scientists are working
on a solution ready for
human trial by peers guilty
