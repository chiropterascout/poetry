```
i understand now
i had a dream about his house
it was boarded up
abandoned
overgrown with weeds and trees
```

```
incubate yesterday
```

```
skeletons in the piano, dancing bones echoing. solitude.
```

```
hope in the denial of reality
```

```
falling into the walls
your eyes have exploded

the invigilator is dead

take the stand
all rise
```
