## leave them in their grave

```
leave them in their grave

in the garden
behind the orchard

leave them for the daisies and the daisies for the bees.

they died already anyway

for a moment, if a moment is enough,
to go beyond the pale and come back as someone else.

they almost died already anyway

for hours, if hours are enough,
but for a timely intervention and becoming someone else.

they almost did again. and again. and again.

they aren't exactly counting since becoming someone else.

leave them in their grave

in the garden, in the quiet.

for the restful call of silence and the embrace of the cold.

leave them in their grave,
that they dug for someone else.
```
