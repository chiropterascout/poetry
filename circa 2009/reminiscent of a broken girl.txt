it's a meaningless distinction
it's a meaningless distraction

    everything is
        slowly
            falling
                apart

stuck on these emotions
stuck on these memories

    everything is
        crashing domn
            around me

never falling never falling

silent

never asked for help I've

  forgotten how
                to
                   feel I've
  forgotten how
                to
                   love

never falling never falling

the screams in my head

never came
