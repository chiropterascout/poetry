## save me from my thoughts

save me from my thoughts
    and the darkness
    and the hurt they cause

save me from my thoughts
    and the sense of who I'm not
    
all the moments when I wonder 
    who 
        I
          really
                 am
                 
and the sense that these delusions
    that one day
    I'll forget
    
that none of thus is real
that none of this is true

that nothing that my thoughts say
say anything that's true

save me from my thoughts
    and the darkness
    and the hurt they cause
    
save me from the delusions and the sense of who

am

I

I am not my thoughts, not these unfocused thoughts
that come at me at night when I feel safe

and secure

save me from this doubt that tarnishes my love

save me from this doubt that twists the way I feel

  into something poisonous
  I know cannot be real
  
save me from my thoughts
    and the darkness
    and the hurt they cause
    
am I afraid of darkness?
                         because I know that's when they come
                        
do I scream in my sleep?
                         because I know that's where they are
                        
in the quiet fucking moments when I feel it all collapse
when all I know is forgotten and I only feel

  the urge
  to make
  the pain
  real
  
the countless scars from every time,
I felt this way before,
I hide them with the bracelets, that I'll always have to wear.

save me from my thoughts
  this is not who I am
  
  I will not be these delusions,
  guilty nor grand.
  
save me from my thoughts
    and the darkness
    and the hurt they cause
    
save me from these delusions
and I'll hold onto what's real

save me from myself while I remember how to feel
