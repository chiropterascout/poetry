## wear the chest pain

```
i live. a home?

yes.

i have a home here
some cubic metres.

mine not mine.
is this life we are living now?


necessary and right.

a home?
digital landmarks and
here is the rent paid in part.

bound to here. a home?

cardboard walls and concrete ceilings.
chaos.

the noise the noise.
here i am digitised here i am everything.
we are faceless.

do anything.
be anything.

i live. a home?


no.

empty words. within. the truth is within.

a home?
```
